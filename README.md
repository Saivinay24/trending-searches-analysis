# WSMA Lab: Trending Searches Analysis

This project is a lab assignment for a Web and Social Media Analytics (WSMA) course. It involves the analysis of a dataset (`trending_searches_in_us.csv`) containing trending Google search queries from the United States.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the trending searches data to identify patterns, popular topics, and insights into public search behavior.

## Methodology

The analysis is conducted in the `trending_searches_analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook and includes the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading:** Reading the `trending_searches_in_us.csv` file into a pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Handling any missing values and formatting data (e.g., converting date columns).
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Identifying the most frequently trending search queries.
    * Analyzing trends over time.
    * Visualizing the top categories or topics of interest.
4.  **Visualization:** Using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create plots and graphs that illustrate the findings.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas (for data manipulation)
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
